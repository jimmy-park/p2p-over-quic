# QUIC++
Let's make P2P clients over QUIC!

## TODO
- Find lightweight QUIC implementations in C++
- Start toy projects using QUIC libraries 
  - File sharing program (compare to FTP, TCP)
  - Unreliable transmission
  - Perfomance measurement : response time, average throughput, and etc.
- Develop a P2P version of it
  - Peer discovery
